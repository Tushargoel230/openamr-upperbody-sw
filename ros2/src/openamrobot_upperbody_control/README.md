# openamrobot_upperbody_control

`ros2_control` configuration for the two OpenArm arms. One file, `config/arm_controllers.yaml`, serves every hardware
profile (`mock`, `gazebo`, `real`; ADR-003): the plugin differs, the controllers do not.

| Controller | Type | Joints |
|---|---|---|
| `joint_state_broadcaster` | `joint_state_broadcaster/JointStateBroadcaster` | all |
| `left_arm_controller`, `right_arm_controller` | `joint_trajectory_controller/JointTrajectoryController` | `openarm_{left,right}_joint1..7`, position command, position and velocity state |
| `left_gripper_controller`, `right_gripper_controller` | `position_controllers/GripperActionController` | `openarm_{left,right}_finger_joint1` |

The controller manager runs at 100 Hz. The file is derived from `enactic/openarm_ros2` (`ros2_controllers.yaml` at
`4e837e1`, Apache-2.0); the header lists the three changes. The one that matters: the Jazzy `GripperActionController`
reads `joint:` (a string), and upstream's `joints:` list makes it fail to configure with "Joint name cannot be empty".

- **The mobile base is not under `ros2_control`.** The base keeps its existing drive plugin and its `/cmd_vel` and `/odom`
  interface; this package must not touch them.
- **No lift controller.** OpenAMRobot 2.0 has a fixed mast; an actuated lift is OpenAMRobot 3.0 scope.

## The gripper controller's deprecation warning: do not "fix" it

Every configure of the gripper controllers logs a deprecation warning. It is left in place on purpose.

1. **What is in use.** `position_controllers/GripperActionController`, serving the `control_msgs/action/GripperCommand`
   action, which is the one upstream's MoveIt configuration expects.
2. **The deprecation is a warning, not a removal.** Jazzy 4.42 still ships and loads it.
3. **The replacement is not a rename.** The non-deprecated `parallel_gripper_action_controller/GripperActionController`
   serves `control_msgs/action/ParallelGripperCommand`, a different action type with a different goal. Moving to it
   changes the gripper interface; it does not tidy a package name.
4. **The warning misspells its own replacement** as `parallel_gripper_controllers/GripperActionController`. That name is
   not registered and will not load.
5. **The choice is not ours to make in this package.** It belongs to `openamrobot-manipulation#11` and ADR-009 point 4
   (open with Om and Adnan), and it will be decided in P10, with MoveIt planning to a gripper, which is the only way to
   learn whether `moveit_simple_controller_manager` can drive `ParallelGripperCommand` at all.

Established in the Jazzy 4.42 binaries (`libgripper_action_controller.so` and `libparallel_gripper_action_controller.so`
strings, `ros2 control list_controller_types`) and live (`ros2 action list -t` shows `ParallelGripperCommand` on the
parallel controller), not from documentation. A third candidate, a `JointTrajectoryController` on the finger joints, is
what `openamrobot-manipulation` bring-up provides today; ADR-009 point 4 lists all three.

## Tests

`test/test_arm_controllers_yaml.py` checks, for every profile, that each joint the YAML names is declared under
`<ros2_control>` with the interfaces its controller needs, that every declared joint has exactly one controller, and that
the `finger_joint2` mimic has none. The runtime counterpart is L01 in `openamrobot_upperbody_bringup`.

See [`openamrobot_upperbody_description`](../openamrobot_upperbody_description/README.md) for the `ros2_control` blocks.
