"""W02 (WARN): with enable_planar_base:=true, KDL has no planar joint, so robot_state_publisher converts base_planar_joint
into a fixed joint and KDL consumers see world -> base_link as static.

Why this is a WARN and not a FAIL, and why it does not touch A6's acceptance:
  - the acceptance is "planar base joint present and disabled". The joint IS present, with type="planar" in the
    description (T11), and check_urdf accepts it (T02, planar expansions);
  - the conversion is a limitation of a downstream consumer (kdl_parser), not a defect of the model;
  - A7 consequence: planar base motion can never come from robot_state_publisher. It comes from Gazebo's odom -> base_link,
    which ADR-003 and ADR-005 already assume.

The test observes the message from a real robot_state_publisher (a few seconds, localhost only) rather than asserting it
from memory, and checks the default expansion does not produce it. It fails only if the condition disappears (then W02 can
be retired), like W01. If robot_state_publisher cannot be run, the sidecar says observed: false and why, and the test SKIPs.
