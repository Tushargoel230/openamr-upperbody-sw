"""What every launch test must check after the launch has stopped: that the processes it needed started, and that none of them died.

`launch_testing` runs the test methods while the launch is up and, unless the module says otherwise, never looks at how the processes ended:
a process of the launch that dies of a signal while the test passes, or one that cannot be started at all, is invisible to the test and so to
the evidence (demonstrated with canaries, P12A task 0: both ended as a passing test and a `0 FAIL` report). So each launch test module ends with

    @launch_testing.post_shutdown_test()
    class TestShutdown(unittest.TestCase):
        def test_processes_started_and_exited_cleanly(self, proc_info):
            assert_launch_healthy(proc_info, expected=["move_group", ...], allowed={"move_group": [SIGSEGV]})

`expected` lists the name prefix of every process the test cannot do without: a process that never started is not in `proc_info` at all (demonstrated with
a canary, an ExecuteProcess whose executable does not exist: the launch carried on with its other processes and the test passed), so only a list kept next to
the launch description can notice it is missing. A process that DIES during the tests is a different failure, caught by the last active test
(`assert_no_process_died`) before the shutdown allowances below can hide it. `allowed` lists the non-zero exit codes a process may end with, per
process, each one a known and documented behaviour of the installed software and nothing broader. `test_h01_harness_guards.py` fails any launch
test module that does not call this, so a new launch test cannot be written without it.
