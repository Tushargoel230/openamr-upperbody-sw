"""The combined OpenAMRobot 2.0 robot in Gazebo Harmonic: the base on its DiffDrive plugin, both arms on gz_ros2_control.

    ros2 launch openamrobot_upperbody_gazebo sim.launch.py [base_plate:=bp000] [headless:=true] [world:=/path/x.sdf]
                                                           [rviz:=true]

What it starts, in this order of dependence
  gz sim                 -r (run), plus -s (server only, no window) when headless:=true
  robot_state_publisher  the combined description at hardware_profile:=gazebo, use_sim_time
  ros_gz_sim create      spawns the model from the robot_description topic; the model carries the base's DiffDrive and
                         JointStatePublisher plugins (platform-sw's, unchanged) and our gz_ros2_control plugin, which
                         starts the controller manager inside the simulator
  ros_gz_bridge          platform-sw's own gz_bridge.yaml, BY REFERENCE (clock, /cmd_vel, /odom, /tf, sensors; every topic
                         Nav2 and docking use, under the names they use), plus one bridge of ours for the base's joint
                         states onto a separate topic (see below)
  spawners               joint_state_broadcaster, then left_arm, right_arm, left_gripper and right_gripper controllers
  joint_state_publisher  the ONLY publisher of /joint_states: it merges the base's wheel joints and the arms' joints, and
                         reports every joint nobody else does (lift_joint) at its default, zero = calibration stop L1000

/joint_states: platform-sw's JointStatePublisher (scoped by its own <joint_name> list to the two wheels) and our
joint_state_broadcaster (the sixteen arm joints) must not both write to /joint_states. The wheels come in on
/base/joint_states, the arms on /arm/joint_states, and joint_state_publisher merges them. See the package README for what
was observed before this was decided.

odom -> base_footprint: from the DiffDrive plugin through the /tf bridge, and from nowhere else (platform-sw 935efc7: the odom
child is base_footprint so that base_link keeps one parent, REP 105). robot_state_publisher cannot publish it, because `odom`
is not a link of the description (and with the planar joint enabled KDL turns it into a fixed joint, check W02). The default
here is enable_planar_base:=false.

Args
  column       dold_v4_350 | tl3_400   (default dold_v4_350; tl3_400 has no supplier data and does not expand)
  base_plate   bp000 | bp050             (default bp000: option B's baseline; column axis x +0.060 / +0.110 from base_link)
  head_pitch   hp15 | hp20 | hp25 | hp30 | hp35   (default hp25)
  base_tilt    bt05 | bt10 | bt15        (default bt10)
  world     path to a Gazebo world .sdf                       (default: worlds/empty.sdf in this package; platform-sw's is
            $(ros2 pkg prefix --share openamrobot_gazebo)/worlds/walled_world.sdf)
  headless  true | false     (default false) true runs `gz sim -s`: no Gazebo window, as the smoke test does
  physics_engine  the gz-physics plugin for whichever world is loaded (default gz-physics-dartsim-plugin: DART, the engine
            platform-sw tuned the base's DiffDrive on, so this launch does not re-baseline someone else's physics).
            DART cannot run this model's grippers: its fingers do not follow position commands and it has no mimic
            constraint, so finger_joint2 never follows finger_joint1. Pass gz-physics-bullet-featherstone-plugin to
            close the grippers (G02 does). See the package README.
  rviz      true | false     (default false) RViz2 with the fixed frame `odom`, beside the simulator, for a person

# --- stopping the simulator (P17 task 1) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# What was measured, because the first version of this handler rested on a guess:
#   * launch starts `gz sim` as `/bin/sh -c "ruby .../gz sim ..."` (ros_gz_sim, shell=True) and signals the SHELL only, so under launch_testing the
#     server receives no signal of the launch at all: whatever stops it has to be done to it directly. (From a terminal, Ctrl-C reaches the whole
#     foreground group, the server included, which is why this never showed by hand.)
#   * the first version asked the server to stop through its /server_control service (the request is answered `data: true`). Over 18 launches
#     under launch_testing it went wrong 4 times: twice the server segfaulted inside libgz-sim8 during its teardown and lingered until the shell was
#     SIGTERMed at 5 s, and twice it accepted the request and never began its teardown (no controller_manager destructor output), ignoring SIGTERM:
#     only SIGKILL ended it, and launch's SIGTERM of the shell at 5 s had left it running as an orphan. From the log history (154 launches) the
#     same failures are 14 segfaults and about 10 silent hangs.
#   * SIGINT sent to the server process itself, which is what Ctrl-C does and which the server's own handler turns into a stop, went wrong 0 times
#     in 24 launches (1.32 to 1.54 s each, against 1.64 to 1.79 s for the service). 24 clean runs do not prove it cannot fail: with a failure
#     rate of 20% the chance of 24 clean ones is under 1%, and with 5% it is 29%.
#   * launch's own OnShutdown fires twice (the shell's death, `on_exit_shutdown`, is a second Shutdown), and a stop run as an ExecuteProcess is not
#     started at all when `context.is_shutdown` is already set (`ros2 launch` and SIGINT: the first firing is a no-op, the second raises
#     "executed more than once" and abandons the rest of the shutdown).
# So, once per launch and from a detached helper (this file run as a script: it imports nothing of ROS, starts in milliseconds and does not depend on
# the launch's state), in this order: SIGINT to the `gz sim` processes; after GZ_STOP_RETRY_AFTER_S, if one is still there, the /server_control
# request as well; after GZ_STOP_GRACE_S, SIGTERM and then SIGKILL. The servers are followed by pid, because launch's SIGTERM of the shell at 5 s
# reparents them out of its tree. The helper writes its report to gz_stop_report_path() BEFORE it signals anything harder than SIGINT, and
# launch_guard.gz_server_shutdown_report reads it (from the evidence directory): a server that had to be forced is a FAIL of the run that did it,
# never a quiet pass.
GZ_STOP_RETRY_AFTER_S = 3.0     # s after the SIGINT before the service request is made as well (a stop takes 1.3-1.8 s when it works)
