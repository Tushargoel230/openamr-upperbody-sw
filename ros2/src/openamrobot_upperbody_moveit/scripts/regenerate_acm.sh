# THE CHECKED-IN SRDF IS THE CONTRACT. Since P12A the matrix is DERIVED, not sampled: a pair is disabled for exactly three reasons (declared by
# upstream, `Adjacent`, `ConstantTransform`) and every other pair is enabled, so nothing depends on a random generator and regenerating gives the
# same matrix every time (test_acm_generation.py runs it twice and requires the contract back). Before P12A the matrix came from the Setup
# Assistant's collisions_updater, which has no seed option and gave a different set of `Never` pairs on every run; it is no longer used.
# Without --write the SRDF and its record are left alone and a proposal is written to a temporary file; with --write the contract is replaced (the
# record, with the new fingerprint, is rewritten too): that is a decision a reviewer has to see in the diff. Verification of the contract is
# scripts/validate_acm.py (M03).
