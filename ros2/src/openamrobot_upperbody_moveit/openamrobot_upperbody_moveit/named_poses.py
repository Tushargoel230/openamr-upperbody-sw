"""Named poses read from the SRDF, and the per-hand gripper sign rule (ADR-009 point 5).

The two grippers take opposite-signed GripperCommand positions: left finger_joint1 range [0, 0.7854], right [-0.7854, 0] (upstream's
convention, not ours). A named pose or helper that closes both hands from one number is wrong on one hand WITHOUT failing at the
point it is written, which is the class of defect that reaches a demo. So the closed value of a hand is never a constant here: it is
that hand's own far limit, read from the URDF, and `gripper_sign_problems` is the check that fails the single-number version.
