"""M04: a goal that puts the left gripper inside the nearest REACHABLE structure volume is REJECTED by planning, and the test says which of the three
things that could happen did: the pipeline refused it, the planner searched and failed, or the planner ran out of time. They are different
claims: "rejected" is the pipeline looking at the goal and refusing it at once; "failed" is a search that gave up; "timed_out" is a search that
used its whole budget. Only the first is the robot refusing to hurt itself; the other two would be a robot that tried.

WHICH VOLUME (VERIFICATION.md M04, corrected 7 Oct: the row said "base collision volume", which was the wrong phrase): the arms cannot reach the
platform's base body at all, so the volume under test is the nearest one they CAN reach. In 6000 random left-arm states at mast_1350 the left gripper touched
`base_link`, the wheels, the casters, the lidar and the camera body in none of them (and M03's 8000 all-joint states found no collision of
any arm link with `base_link` at any mast ID), while it touched `mast_base_link`, the mast structure on the base that the arms are mounted
on, in 144. So the goal is inside `mast_base_link`'s collision volume, the nearest base-side volume that a left gripper can be put in, and the
record says so. That the base body is out of reach is itself a finding about the arm geometry (A4's question, not ours).

The fixture is a left-arm joint state found by scripts/validate_acm.py's sampler (numpy default_rng(4242), sample index 25 of the left-arm-only
search at mast_1350); the test checks, through move_group's /check_state_validity, that it really collides with the mast before using it, so a
change of the model fails here with that message and not by quietly testing a goal that no longer collides.

Two goals are sent, both plan-only (nothing executes) and through move_group's /plan_kinematic_path service: a JOINT goal (the fixture's joint
values) and a POSE goal (the position and orientation of the left gripper at the fixture, from /compute_fk). A third request, a named pose that
is free, must plan: the harness is not vacuous. The service and not the MoveGroup action, because the action collapses every planning failure
into the generic FAILURE (99999) with no planning time, which cannot tell a refusal from a timeout; the service returns the pipeline's own code
and planning time.

What the installed MoveIt does (read from move_group's log, MoveIt 2.12.4): for the JOINT goal OMPL finds the contact at once ("Found a contact
between mast_base_link and openarm_left_ee_link2"), logs "Unable to sample any valid states for goal tree" after about 20 ms and fails with
GOAL_STATE_INVALID: a refusal. For the POSE goal it spends the WHOLE planning budget looking for a collision-free goal (5.0 s between the same
two log lines) and then fails with the same code GOAL_STATE_INVALID: a search that timed out, with a refusal's name. Same code, different claims."""
