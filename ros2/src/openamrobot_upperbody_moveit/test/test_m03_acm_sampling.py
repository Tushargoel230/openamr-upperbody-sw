"""M03: the SRDF's collision matrix disables only what can be justified (scripts/validate_acm.py, acm_derive.py, moveit_py).

A pair may be disabled for exactly three reasons: declared by upstream (section 1 of the SRDF, the 20 pairs upstream states), `Adjacent` (a structural
neighbour) or `ConstantTransform` (no movable joint between the links: one evaluation settles every configuration, and it found them clear). Everything
else is ENABLED, including every pair whose only credential would be that a sampler saw no collision. M03 recomputes the reasons from the model and
FAILs a disabled pair with no reason, a label that is not true, a ConstantTransform pair that collides, and an enabled constant pair that collides (a
permanent collision). There is no WARN class. The sampled part is information about the ENABLED pairs, for A4.

THIS TEST IS NOT SOFTENED: the mutation tests below show that each way the matrix can be wrong fails the check, by planting that defect in a copy of the
SRDF, and that the defects are real: every pair they use is one that really collides or really has a movable joint between its links."""
