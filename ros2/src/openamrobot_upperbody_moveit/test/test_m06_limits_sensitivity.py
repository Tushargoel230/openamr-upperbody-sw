"""M06 (adopted 7 Oct, VERIFICATION.md): the named-pose plans NEED some acceleration limit and do not DEPEND on the values we invented (ADR-009).

Runs scripts/limits_sensitivity.py: all twelve named-pose plans (both arms, both grippers) under the configured limits scaled by 1, 0.1, 0.01
and 0.001, and under no acceleration limits at all (upstream's own state, manipulation#10). The A7 stop condition is "planning succeeds only
because the acceleration limits we invented are generous": it would show here as a plan that fails under a tight scaling."""
