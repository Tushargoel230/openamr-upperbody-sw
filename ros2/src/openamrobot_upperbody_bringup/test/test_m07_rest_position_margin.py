"""M07: at rest in Gazebo, no joint sits within a margin of either of its limits (P17 task 2).

THE RULE (Alex's posted rule for M07, as P27 states it; point 2 of it assigns the handling of non-finite samples to this repository. His comment's
own wording was not re-read when this was written):
  - the expected joints are the 16 limited joints under ros2_control (both arms' joint1..7 and both finger_joint1); `lift_joint` and the mimic
    `finger_joint2`s are excluded, and RECORDED in the sidecar as not independently measured, with the reason;
  - the margin is 0.001 rad (the datum `joint_rest_margin_rad`, read from datums.yaml, never a literal here);
  - WARN, never PASS, only for `openarm_{left,right}_finger_joint1` and `openarm_{left,right}_joint4` at an inherited upstream limit (within the margin
    of it, either side);
  - FAIL for anything more than 0.001 rad beyond a physical limit, those four included; FAIL for any other joint within the margin;
  - non-finite raw positions (NaN, +inf, -inf) are rejected BEFORE the coverage count and before any extremum; a non-finite value never counts toward the
    50-sample minimum per joint; the rejected readings are preserved in the sidecar (`invalid_readings`); any non-finite reading is a FAIL, never a PASS
    or a WARN. The decision is `a7_support.evaluate_m07`, a pure function with its own regression (test_m07_non_finite.py).

Why this is a check of its own. In option B's body the right finger rests ON its open limit (-4.7e-6 .. +2.7e-8 rad); the old body rested 6.0e-5
rad inside it. A joint that rests on a limit straddles it: solver noise carries it across, the joint-state clamp fires thousands of times a run
(the count scatters 2-3x on an unchanged tree, which is why that count no longer gates anything), and every downstream number moves with it.
That is a modelling defect whether or not anything notices. A version of this check that passes on the right finger is wrong: the joints in
AT_UPSTREAM_LIMIT, whose rest pose is an upstream limit by construction, are WARN (recorded with the reason), never PASS; any other joint
within the margin, or one of those read further past its limit than the margin, is FAIL.

What it measures. Nothing is commanded: the simulator is started (headless, Bullet-Featherstone like G02 and M02, so the fingers behave), the
five controllers are waited for until active, the model settles, and the RAW joint states the physics produced (`/arm/joint_states`, the
joint_state_broadcaster's own topic: not the clamped copy move_group sees, not joint_state_publisher's merge) are read for a window of
simulated time. For every joint with limits the result keeps the lowest and highest reading and the distance of each from the nearer limit
(negative = past it). A joint FAILs when either extreme is closer than the margin.

The margin is a datum, `joint_rest_margin_rad` in datums.yaml, with its source and status there: not a literal here. The test reads it from the
installed description package and records the value it used.

What it does not cover, said so in the sidecar and never silently skipped: `lift_joint` (not under ros2_control; its state is
joint_state_publisher's default zero, which is its lower stop by construction, so there is no physics rest position to read) and the wheels
(continuous, no limits).

`simulation` class: how this model rests in this simulator on this machine. It says nothing about a physical robot or its limits.
