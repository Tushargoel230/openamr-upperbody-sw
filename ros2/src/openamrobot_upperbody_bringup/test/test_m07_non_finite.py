"""M07 rejects non-finite joint positions and cannot pass on them (PR #14 review, Mohammad, twice; P27). No simulator, no ROS graph.

THE RULE this pins (Alex's posted rule for M07, as P27 states it; point 2 assigns the non-finite case to this repository. His comment's own wording was not
re-read when this was written):
  - 16 limited joints are expected; `lift_joint` and the mimic `finger_joint2`s are excluded and RECORDED as not independently measured;
  - the margin is 0.001 rad;
  - WARN only for `openarm_{left,right}_finger_joint1` and `openarm_{left,right}_joint4` at an inherited upstream limit;
  - FAIL for anything more than 0.001 rad beyond a physical limit, those four included;
  - non-finite raw positions are rejected BEFORE the coverage count and before the extrema; a non-finite value never counts toward the 50-sample
    minimum; the rejected readings are preserved; the check is FAIL, never PASS or WARN.

Before (ba5b4ea): a NaN compares false with everything, so 50 NaNs per expected joint gave a coverage of 50, `min`/`max` of NaN, a distance of NaN,
`within_margin` False and a PASS (reproduction a); 49 finite readings and one NaN counted 50 and passed too (reproduction b).
The helper tests need only the installed packages; the model tests expand the real URDF.
